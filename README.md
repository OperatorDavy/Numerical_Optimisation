# Numerical Optimisation

This repository contains my report and code for the numerical optimisation project I did at UCL for my masters. It is about training Gaussian and LAplacian kernels each optimised with Sequential Minimal Optimisation (SMO) or a variant of Augmented Lagrangian method, to classify toy data and MNIST data.
